## Tailoring Tips

1. **Match the job description**: Highlight the skills and achievements that align with the specific job requirements
2. **Quantify achievements**: Include metrics and percentages whenever possible
3. **Use action verbs**: Start each bullet with a strong action verb (developed, implemented, designed, etc.)
4. **Focus on impact**: Emphasize how your technical implementation solved business problems
5. **Be specific**: Mention the exact technologies and methodologies you used
